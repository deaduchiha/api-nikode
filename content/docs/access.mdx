# API Access & Permissions Guide

Understanding who can access what in the Nikode API is crucial for proper integration and security. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of all access levels, permissions, and restrictions.

## 🔐 **Authentication Overview**

The API uses a hybrid authentication system with both public and protected endpoints:

- **Public Routes**: Can be accessed without API keys (read-only operations)
- **Protected Routes**: Require valid API keys for access
- **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are determined by your API key's role
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: Higher roles inherit all permissions from lower roles

### **Public Endpoints** (No API Key Required)
- `GET /api/characters` - Browse all characters with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/characters/[id]` - View detailed character information
- `GET /api/comments` - View all comments with filtering
- `GET /api/search` - Search across characters and comments

### **Protected Endpoints** (API Key Required)
- All write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- User management endpoints
- Admin-only operations

| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Public    | 50            | 5/minute    |

- **System Operations**: Only admins can perform system-level operations

## 🧪 **Testing Your Access**

Use the interactive API testers in our documentation to verify your permissions:

1. **Visit any API documentation page** (e.g., `/docs/characters`)
2. **Select your API key** from the dropdown (or leave empty for public access)
3. **Try different operations** to test your access level
4. **Check response codes** to understand permission restrictions

### **Expected Response Codes**

- **200 OK**: Operation successful
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid API key (for protected endpoints)
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions for operation
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded

## 🔄 **Role Hierarchy**

```
Admin (Full Access)
    ↓
Moderator (Content Management)
    ↓
User (Basic Access)
    ↓
Public (Read-only Access)
```

Each higher role inherits all permissions from lower roles, plus additional capabilities specific to their level.

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you're experiencing access issues:

1. **Verify your API key** is correct and active (for protected endpoints)
2. **Check your role permissions** for the operation you're trying to perform
3. **Review rate limits** to ensure you haven't exceeded quotas
4. **Contact support** if you need elevated permissions

The hybrid authentication system ensures security while providing appropriate functionality for each user type.
